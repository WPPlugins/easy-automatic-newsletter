========================================

WordPress plugin - Easy Automatic Newsletter. The easy-to-use WordPress plug-in that recycles your blog posts into a monthly newsletter and sends it out automatically, every month!  Easy Automatic Newsletter plug-in does exactly what it is called. Instead of sweating bullets every time it's time to make a newsletter, all you need to focus on with our plug-in is to keep blogging and tweeting great content. If you can write a blog post every week you will have enough content for your newsletter. If you write more than that, you'll have a robust newsletter begging the question from recipients "How do you have time to do that?"  Let's face it, not everyone you already know reads your blog. And in an age where recycling is good, don't let great content be used for a single audience.  Wouldn't it be nice to take a month's worth of blog posts and format it into an e-mail newsletter and send it out to your subscribers? That's exactly what our plug-in will do. It will also include your Tweets as well. Once configured (takes about 10 minutes), it works automatically every month. All you need to do is keep blogging and tweeting. Tweeting, by the way, is optional for the plug-in.
